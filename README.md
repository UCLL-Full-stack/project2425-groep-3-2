# Family chore manager

The Family Chore Manager app is an app that helps families organize and track household chores with a built-in rewards system. Parents can assign tasks to their children, set deadlines, and assign points to each chore. Children can mark chores as completed to earn points, which can be redeemed for rewards such as more screentime, an extra snack in the evening and so on. Parents have the final say in approving or rejecting chore completion and reward claims.
